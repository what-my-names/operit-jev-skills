# Find and verify source evidence

## Use safely

Choose the service once and keep that choice. If unset, ask **A: real Jev** via
OpenRouter (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) or TypeSafe (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`), or **B: simulation**
with this agent or an explicitly chosen available model such as DeepSeek. Wait for
consent; errors do not authorize switching. Check key presence only, never values.
Real calls send evidence and cost money; get approval before sending private data.

For B, skip CLI/API calls. Mark `agent_simulation` or `model_simulation`, identify
the actual model when available, set `jev_called: false`, `probability: null` and
`confidence: null`. Return a value, evidence-based reason and `needs_review`; use
null/review when evidence is missing. Do not invent Jev output or probabilities.
Choice uses supplied labels, Noul uses booleans, Score uses integer rubric indices.

For A, use the existing `jev-decide` CLI with the chosen `--provider openrouter`
or `--provider typesafe`. If absent, explain the dependency; do not silently install.
`--dry-run` is offline validation, not a judgment. Exit 0 means selected/scored,
2 means review, 1 means error. Read each value: false Noul remains false. Selection
is not permission, and confidence is not accuracy. Keep unknown/review paths.

## First request

Adapt [the example](assets/example.json). The shared CLI needs Python 3.10+;
no sibling skill is needed. Host tools still own collection and actions.
Resolve `<skill-dir>` to this installed folder:

```bash
jev-decide decide <skill-dir>/assets/example.json --dry-run
# After approval, send the edited request with the selected provider:
jev-decide decide /path/to/request.json --provider openrouter
```

## Choose the evidence workflow

- **Documents:** follow the workflow below for original spans, passage relevance
  and claim checks; adapt [the document template](assets/example.json).
- **Code locations:** read [code-location selection](references/find-code.md)
  and adapt [the code-location template](assets/find-code.json). Use the project's
  required graph/index tools first. Inspect selected code before making claims.
- **Judging whether a change is correct:** use `jev-eval` if installed, rather
  than treating a relevance score as a code-review result.

## Workflow

1. Read the authorized source and retain document/page/line identifiers. Have parsers or regex produce exact candidate spans when possible.
2. Define the requested role precisely: invoice destination is not any email address. Include none when no candidate fits.
3. Use independent relevance questions when ranking all passages; winning a relative Choice does not establish an answer exists.
4. Copy the original span selected by ID. Do not ask Jev to synthesize the extracted field or fabricate a quotation.
5. Check each claim against its cited evidence separately. Report unsupported/contradicted statements and preserve source links for human checking.

## Context and parallelism

Jev does not inherit the agent's history. Give every request sufficient context:
the user's information need, exact claim, source IDs, surrounding passages,
definitions and relevant exceptions. Supply the text, not just a URL or your own
summary verdict. Keep needed cross-references; omit unrelated material and secrets.

Batch independent claim checks or per-passage relevance scores over shared state
instead of serial LLM calls. For separate document groups, use bounded concurrency
with stable document/question IDs, rate limits and a cost/time budget. The host
schedules calls; the CLI has no parallel scheduler. Questions cannot read other
answers in the same request: fetch a selected source before asking about unseen
contents. Use Jev's low latency for repeated judgments, not document generation.

## Make it yours

Replace the example's evidence, candidate IDs and criteria together. Preserve a
no-match route when the real task can fall outside the labels. Agree on how the
host or person consumes each answer before enabling any automatic effect.

there is no need to read the full README before a judgment.
